## Where I Left Off

- I was able to implement most of the logic to use IPCM as the contract stanard and implement db versioning with timestamps
- Next steps
  - Deploy an IPCM contract, look into multiple ownership / roles?
  - Hook it up to the app and test
  - See how well conflict resolution happens
